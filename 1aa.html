	After walking for some time, Mina was about to turn back, giving up hope of finding the cat - and continuing on the quite sensible day of school, and chores and vegetables, until she heard a faint
	<br>
	<br>
	<i>"meeeow"</i>
	<br>
	<br>
	She began to amble over to where the sound was eminating from, and discovered a quite out of place hole in the ground, but not some ordinary hole, this had a golden ring around it, she could see just faintly, a ladder descending into the darkness.
