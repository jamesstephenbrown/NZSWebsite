REHAB GETS A GOOD RAP </h1><p>

There can be a tendency with the retributive justice cohort to look at punishment as justice, and rehab as assistance. But this is to give rehab far too rosy a reading. Rehab is extraordinarily difficult, and very few people would opt for it unless they were forced. You, as someone who is lacking in any sense of self-control are put in an environment with other problematic people, and are forced to control yourself under very trying circumstances. You are forced to do things with your mind that are highly uncomfortable, and essentially deny who you are until you completely change who you are. Prison on the other hand requires no change and presents no challenge to your identity.</p>
