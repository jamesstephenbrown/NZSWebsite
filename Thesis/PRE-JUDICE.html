PRE-JUDICE </h1><p>

But to equivocate between these targets of prejudice, is to misrepresent what prejudice means. To pre-judge someone is to judge them without any knowledge of who they are as a person, which holds true for racial, sexual, class, non-belief judgment, because knowing those aspects of someone tells you nothing about them as a person. In the case of Christian fundamentalists, big business, the Tea Party, and the military; membership in these high-choice groups can tell you a lot about the person’s own prejudices, their motivations, and their likely actions - in fact many of these groups don’t just describe the group but prescribe their actions in the world. So, this is not purely prejudice, but fairly defensible judgement.<br></p>
