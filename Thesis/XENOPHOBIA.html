XENOPHOBIA</h1><p>

When it comes to migration, people fear, not only racial differences, but also the erosion of cultural values we hold dear. Why? Because there is a tendency in the west to believe that because our values have resulted in greater wealth and in many cases greater safety and well being, therefore our values must be superior. And yet many in the west don’t hold the corresponding confidence that these “superior” values will hold their ground.<br><br>So, there are two flawed assumptions here:<br><br>That a wealthier society has nothing to learn from a poorer society.<br>That inferior values will win when pitted against superior values.<br><br>Anyone who has traveled to developing nations will have noticed regressive aspects of the culture that are clearly holding back progress, but at the same time, there are truly unexpected and sublime aspects of other cultures that you would want to take “back home” with you. I would suggest that there is much that we can learn from others, about how happy people can be with less, how welcoming people can be and how present you can feel in an environment. We also need to trust that better systems and better aspects of culture will rise to the top when put in a fair competition with others. Migrant cultures contribute to society in many positive ways, and we see this contribution bear out in tax statistics where migrants and even second generation refugees contribute more to society than local populations. As long as there is an open sharing of values, on both sides, the best elements of society should flourish.</p>
