WE DON’T LIVE IN A MERITOCRACY </h1><p>

People living in the capitalist centres of the UK and USA may believe that their societies promote freedom of opportunity for their citizens. A lower tax rate than other European developed countries is supposed to spur innovation and empower people to make something of themselves. However social mobility statistics in those countries do not bear this out; with 50% of social advantage being passed on from generation to generation, as opposed to 20% in Denmark. As Joseph Stigltiz states…<br><br>“If Americans want to live the American dream, they should move to Denmark”.<br><br>This is also reflected (understandably) in inequality within countries, with Denmark’s being the lowest, and the US up there with Chile, Peru and Argentina - dictatorships that US capitalists would describe as victims of socialism. Since the post-war tax hikes (up to 94%) which doubled social mobility for about a decade, lowering taxes has been proportional to the lowering of social mobility in the states. So how do we remedy this?</p>
