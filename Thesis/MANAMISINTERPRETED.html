MANA MISINTERPRETED</h1><p>

I have searched for a word to describe the vibe you get from someone with profound integrity, I had for some time thought that the Maori concept of mana filled this purpose, disappointingly this turns out to be just another form of inherited or granted prestige in the same fashion of royalty. However, people I’ve spoken to who use the word also share my interpretation.<br><br>The sense of this concept I’m seeking is as Marcus Aurelius describes<br>A man should habituate himself to such a way of thinking that if suddenly asked, “What is in your mind at this minute?” he could respond frankly and without hesitation; thus proving that all his thoughts were simple and kindly.<br><br>My sense is that humans have evolved a sense of how to detect this genuine integrity (that being a union of the inside and outside) and that some people, when you meet them simply have this brand of authentic charisma. This public charisma reflects a private habitual effort, and this public value reflects a private generosity. Aurelius reflects this intuition when he states.</p>
