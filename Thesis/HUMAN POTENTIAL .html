HUMAN POTENTIAL </h1><p>

To look at the opportunity for a moment, as opportunities have been opened to a wider population the results have almost always been positive. Every great thinker in the past 200 years has benefitted from access to public goods that increased opportunities from the printing press, to the public school system. When we see the numbers of people starving, oppressed and uneducated around the world, that is lost potential for humanity. Neil deGrasse Tyson put it this way<br><br>“If everyone had the luxury of expressing their unique combination of talents in this world, our society would be transformed overnight”.<br><br>While Jeff Hammerbacher, a tech wiz from Silicon Valley and an early Facebook programmer laments the position of even the most privileged minds.<br><br>“The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people play ads.”<br><br>And let’s remember, humanity doesn’t have all the answers yet, we need our best people working on it, and to find those people we need create a platform for everyone to reach their potential.<br></p>
