WE DON’T LIVE TO WORK or WHY I STOPPED WORRYING AND LEARNED TO LOVE MILLENNIALS </h1><p>

People attach a lot of their self-worth to their work, and one of the pet-hates of gen-Xers around millennials is that they do this the “wrong” way around. Gen-Xers worked at the job in which they found themselves and learned to “love the one you’re with”. Millennials hesitate to step into a job that doesn’t align with them as a person. I would posit that this attitude is going to serve them well in a future, where they are likely to be unemployed, where mundane tasks are automated and a person’s originality becomes their product. If we manage to build a system of benign coercion with values that reflect conscious experience as the unit of value, we will do well to focus on priorities that benefit conscious well-being; the environment, unity, charity.<br></p>
