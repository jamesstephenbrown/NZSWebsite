WHO STARTED IT? </h1><p>

While we can definitely see mirror-images in the white nationalists and Antifa for example, it is important to ask the school-ground question “Who started it?”. While all of these groups will claim they are reacting to some form of victimhood, some have a more solid footing in this regard. Movements started by minority groups who have been historically oppressed - Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ pronoun advocates, equal-pay feminists etc are in a reactionary position with history and make a fair assessment that equality is not where it could be in a free society. White nationalists are only a reaction to the reaction of civil rights activists and in many cases are simply using that as a way to position themselves as reactionary, when actually there are clear through lines back to the very groups who “Started it”. So, the claim that these are mirror images of one another is a false equivocation.<br></p>
