PRIMACY OF STORY</h1><p>

Jordan Peterson and Yuval Noah Harari distill the literary utility of religions in different ways. Peterson celebrates them as part of religion’s benefits, and wants to call them a form of “truth”. Harari, on the other hand, includes them in a continuum of fictions that have served to coordinate large groups of people. Harari sees religion as just the beginning of social fictions that have grown and evolved to those we live with today like human rights, money and limited liability companies. Peterson fails to see the continuum and so clings to his religious predilections in calling them truth, and rationalising their continued persistence. Both however understand that stories are vital to social change.</p>
