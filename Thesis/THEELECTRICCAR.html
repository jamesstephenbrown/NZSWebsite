A STORY ABOUT THE ELECTRIC CAR</h1><p>

Let’s say a car company wants to go electric, now they are no longer costing the environment the tolls of exhaust fumes, so, given the assumption that all actions are zero-sum it is assumed that the cost will all now be taken up in R&D, and that cost will be completely paid for by the company rather than spread across the entire populous. This seems to suggest to the car company that they will lose advantage, because there is no world they can see in which they can continue to benefit from the fruits of their R&D without paying some new cost to balance the zero-sum equation.<br><br>So, given that mentality, it’s no surprise it has taken so long for electric cars to become a widely accepted option for car companies.</p>
