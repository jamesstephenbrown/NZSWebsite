THE GRADIENTS OF MORALITY </h1><p>

Basically moral agents are those capable of moral choices, and moral concerns are the <a href ="INESCAPABLYVALUE-LADENEXPERIENCES.html">inescapably value-laden experiences</a> of beings, regardless of those beings’ capacities for choice. Moral concerns extend to include all conscious creatures.<br><br>But it’s more complex than that. First of all there are, as always, gradients of capacity, so even a dog might qualify as a moral agent given that its behaviour can be modified to produce more or less pain. At the same time a human, who has suffered great trauma might be severely diminished in their capacity to act with compassion, similarly with a psychopath. So, the gradient is not smooth, but dithered.<br><br>This all seems to ignore our earlier concession that choice is not free, and so it is important to add to this the power structures in the world which can amplify or alleviate much greater amounts of pain across the world, this is a separate spectrum which goes all the way down to the privilege of those who can cast a single vote.<br><br>So, there are 3 gradients of moral significance<br></p>
