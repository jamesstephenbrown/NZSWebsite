FATALISM </h1><p>

Conceding that Free Will in some respects is illusory does not mean to say that reality is a farce and you can throw up our hands and sit on the couch. First of all fatalism is undermined by randomness, in that randomness makes the future unpredictable, so your fate is not written. Secondly, as I understand it, while much of what we perceive as our unified self is illusory, our conscious decision-making process is not irrelevant. Whether your evaluation of the brainâ€™s prediction errors influence your future decisions by shaping your neurophysiology or whether you have determined that to reach a goal you need to alter your state of mind by taking a shower, your identification with these processes is not redundant. <br><br>Abdicating my responsibility to take part in this process will not result in the same outcome as taking part - it will end in disaster for me and those around me, and this consequence will not be simply academic. It is why evolution has programmed us to act as we do.<br></p>
