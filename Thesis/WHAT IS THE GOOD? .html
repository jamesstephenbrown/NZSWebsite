WHAT IS THE GOOD? </h1><p>

With the acknowledgment of inescapably value-laden experience we might be tempted to say that good is pleasure and bad is pain. To a large extent this philosophically controversial view is actually quite accurate, in as much as it is accurate, it is also trivial (a deepity without the depth).<br><br>What people mean when they speak about a good person is actually an altruistic person, someone who is unwilling to compromise the wellbeing of others in seeking their own goals and / or someone who spreads happiness, bad people are the contrary. So, good is rooted in inescapably value-laden experiences but is relative to others; a moral agent’s behaviour towards moral concerns. All this was enough to give us nature red in tooth and claw in the wild, it is not enough of a foundation on which to build a moral society.<br><br>Moral privilege brings a big solution and myriad new problems. Structures such as laws and currency are power structures whereby trust can be garnered, amplifying benefits. But we are faced with many problematic aspects of moral privilege that grow as our social spheres expand and compound.<br><br>	We can eat meat we didn’t kill<br>	We can fight anonymously online<br>	We can send drones to fight wars<br>	We can vote without judgment<br>	We can give or not give to charity without transparency<br>	We can benefit from our ancestor’s spoils<br>	We can live happily while others make our clothes in sweatshops<br><br>Today, due to a lack of moral transparency, the biggest moral questions are those related to moral privilege; how we can best exercise our own and how we can augment power structures to benefit everyone.</p>
