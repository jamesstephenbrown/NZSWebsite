Since Reagan and Thatcher drastically cut taxes in the 80s, capitalism has lead to greater and greater inequality. While it won out over communism, it largely did so because of the strength the US had gained post-war in the high tax environment of the 50s and 60s.

The profits accrued through gains in productivity started going elsewhere.</p>
