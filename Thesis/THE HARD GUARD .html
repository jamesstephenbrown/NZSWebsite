THE HARD GUARD </h1><p>

Wilson is a prison guard, he is generally a nice bloke, he has a loving family, gives to charity, never pirates movies online. As he marches along the rows of cells he looks at the inmates and thinks about what differentiates him from those on the other side of the bars. He remembers numerous times he was “disciplined” as a child, when once his teacher fractured his pinky finger when wracking his knuckles with a ruler, and thinks “my law abiding nature was shaped by those experiences”. He forgets hundreds of small gestures of trust he was given throughout his life which subtly communicated a sense of responsibility in him, or the security he felt as the son of a father who picked up litter off the street as he walked him home from school. Instead the guard rattles his truncheon against the bars implying to the inmates that he is ready to deliver them a “formative experience” if they choose to step out of line.</p>
