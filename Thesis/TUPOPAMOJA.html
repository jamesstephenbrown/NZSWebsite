TUPO PAMOJA </h1><p>

In Tanzania there is a Swahili phrase “Tupo Pamoja” which translates to “We are together” and is used widely to express “everything is okay”, “We’ve got your back” or “I forgive you” and is even made part of their elaborate greetings which often go back and forth for several minutes. The phrase reminds everyone of their responsibility to each other. Each of us is grappling with difficult decisions, and each of us is affected by the other’s decisions. The cliche that we are all in this boat together is made more real if you realise we are building this ship as we sail.<br><br>So, I hope I’ve made the case that this is about everyone.</p>
