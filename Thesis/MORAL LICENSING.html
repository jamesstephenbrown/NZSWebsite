MORAL LICENSING</h1><p>

Researchers at Stanford University have surveyed a vast range of studies that demonstrate that “When under threat that their next action might be (or appear to be) morally dubious, individuals can derive confidence from their past moral behaviour”. In one study by Sachdeva, Illiev and Medin, participants were asked to write a self-relevant story containing words referring to either positive or negative traits, and then were prompted to make a donation. Participants who wrote a story referring to the positive traits donated one fifth as much as those who wrote a story referring to the negative traits. This experiment was combined with a number of others confirming that a morally positive self-image leads people to feel licensed to act immorally and visa versa.<br>It is important to be as accurate as possible in our Utilitarian Calculus, because humans have an innate sense of fairness; in evolutionary psychology this is our instinct for reciprocal altruism which is common in many social species. If someone feels they have contributed more than their fair share they are likely to skimp or cheat in other areas. This might be all well and good as long as the calculus is correct, at worst it would result in a neural outcome. But what happens when when someone is mistaken and perceives an action to have been a great contribution when it was actually a detriment to society? Then society is double cheated because it is wronged by the virtue and then by the vice.</p>
