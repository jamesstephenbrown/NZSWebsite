A BETTER EQUATION</h1><p>

The dichotomy of control might be made more useful and flexible if we look at the equation VxA; The Value of the Outcome x My ability to Achieve the Outcome, this is the VA value. In this way we could see the dichotomy of control having this relationship but with a threshold value of one 1x1 is worth doing 1x0 is not and 0x1 is not. However VxA makes the vital distinction between a high value / low probability option; 200 x 0.4 and a low value / high probability; 3 x 1.1. The dichotomy of control would class the first as “Out of control” and the second as “In control” VA makes the value of the first 80 and the value of the second 3.3 making the first the far more desirable option.<br>This has the value of allowing you to focus on worthy goals at the exclusion of others, without missing out on difficult yet fruitful endeavours. But the lack of nuance is not the only thing wrong with stoicism.</p>
