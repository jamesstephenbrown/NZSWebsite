UNLEARNING</h1><p>

The fact that instincts are hard-wired does not mean we cannot reverse them. This also does not mean we must deny our instincts and feelings. Denial would be contrary to our well-being, because our instincts and feelings are part of who we are and what we value. As touched on in the section of free will however, there are ways for people to be better aware of what is in their own best interests and how competing desires and physiological necessities can find harmony. The thing about correcting your perspective is that it only takes open experience, real world testing - weâ€™re not trying to be optimistic, or positive - we are presently hard-wired for pessimism and are simply trying to form a view based on reality.<br></p>
