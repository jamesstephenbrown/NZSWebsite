THAT KNOWING SMIRK</h1><p>

Two officers agree to make each other look good by sending thousands of soldiers to their deaths. It is a small action, that alone has devastating effects, and yet for the two officers they get not only career advancement, but importantly, with that knowing smirk, each feels a sense of validation from their fellow officer.<br><br>This need for validation is a human need, part of our condition, but it is especially so for maladapted old men.<br><br>The officers do this indirectly, because this has become their mode of communication. In a practical sense it gives them plausible deniability, but also, because they have grown up unable feel safe showing vulnerability around other men, they can only validate one another indirectly. In the same way that Cockney Slang is designed to evade police interference, the indirect mode of communication is designed to preclude questioning and responsibility. And so it takes on a life of its own, a will to do the deceitful thing.</p>
