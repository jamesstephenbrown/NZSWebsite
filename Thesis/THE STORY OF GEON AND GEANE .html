THE STORY OF GEON AND GEANE </h1><p>

Let’s take for a minute the perspective of Geon and Geane; two genes who have no minds, but they have phenotypic effects on the animals they inhabit. Geon has the effect of making its animal hungrier than most, Geane has the effect of making its animal generous to those around it. Geon’s animal is highly motivated to find food, Geon’s animal therefore avoids starving to death, meanwhile Geon’s animal reproduces and has 2 surviving offspring, one of the offspring contains Geon! Long live Geon.<br><br>Geane’s animal has very difficult life, through a period of drought food is scarce. Geane’s Animal lives on the verge of starvation, despite this Geane’s animal gives an even share of food to every member of family and friends, many of whom contain Geane. Geane’s animal dies from an illness, but 4 other animals that contain Geane survive the drought due to the even distribution of food. The 4 animals each have 2 surviving offspring. Geane lives on in half of the offspring, so although our Geane’s animal has died, 4 Geanes live on. Long live Geane.<br><br>Geane and Geon do not care if they replicated by their own animal or another animal. So, in many cases altruistic behaviour by a gene’s animal can result in the perpetual transmission of those genes.</p>
