A THIRD WAY</h1><p>

This is a difficult choice, but as with many seeming dichotomies, it is important to ask “Is there a third way?”. Initially we squared the paradox of entropy with a theory of emergence, overcame David Hume’s “no ought from is” with the concept of inescapably value laden experiences, squared the illusion of free will with determined randomness, and we found a way of threading the needle with Socio-Capitalism which involved piecemeal change towards curbing extremes of struggle and optimising happiness and character. In regards to the individual, we replaced Stoicism’s dichotomy of control with a more nuanced equation. We overcame the zero-sum nature of charity vs moral licensing by automating charity. We bridged the gap between the expert and the lay person with the Feynman technique. We overcame the dichotomy of religious dogma vs absurdity by exploring the validity of our consciousness-centric perspective. We pointed to sharing our vulnerability as a way to overcome the personal struggle for authenticity with the loopy anxiety that accompanies it. We pointed to genuine virality as a way to overcome the dichotomy of individual vs authoritarian change. We pointed to ways to capitalise on the twin urges for progress and against disadvantageous environments to benefit ourselves and others. But what do we make of the dichotomy between emergence and consciousness?<br><br>“What is our plan as a species?” asks Silicon Valley venture capitalist Bryan Johnson.
