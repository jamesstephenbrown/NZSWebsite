WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH OUR THINKING?</h1><p>

While it is clear that we live on a planet that supports emergent life, there can be a tendency to, without even an awareness of the 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics, assume that our interactions with one another must also adhere to a law of conservation, which manifests as zero-sum thinking. This is the assumption that every benefit must come with an equal and opposite cost, and that for every winner there must be a loser, so the sum total benefit from any interaction is always zero (hence zero-sum).<br><br>In fact, there is a way in which many people are even adhering to the second law, and assuming a negative sum game that the total benefit most always be less than zero, this manifests in a scarcity mentality that says it is worth gaining for myself even at a greater cost to others.</p>
