SUPPLY AND DEMAND </h1><p>

There are many products where the pricing is worked out simply by supply and demand. The price will rise if the demand is higher than the supply, resulting in an incentive to produce that high-value product, resulting in more producers and a lowering of prices until the system reaches a balance. This is what Adam Smith called the invisible hand of the market. Seeing how magical the capitalist paradigm can be, many would like to leave all of the worldâ€™s issues up to the market, however not all products are profitable, some a liabilities;  those liabilities are called humans, and capitalism does not provide for their needs. So, this human needs require a different approach, but can still play into a non-zero sum equation.<br></p>
