WHAT NOW?</h1><p>

In the same way as wealth yields high returns (in happiness) at the bottom and diminishing returns as wealth increases, there is a similar relationship with lifeâ€™s struggles and the development of character, indeed they are related. Let me try to explain. In the case of struggle vs character, granting the traditional understanding that struggle builds character, if someone faces no struggle in their life they develop no character and as struggle slowly increases, so too does character. Then as struggle continues to increase there are diminishing returns, until you reach a threshold where the spur to innovation becomes the heal spur, discouraging action and improvement. So, not only do the returns diminish, they regress leading to anti-social behaviour. At both ends you end up with people who are commonly referred to as assholes... or might be better understood as the horseshoe of blue-collar and white-collar crime. As with happiness and wealth, there is a sweet spot in this curve, an optimal range of struggle.</p>
