RESPONSIBILITY PERSONALITIES </h1><p>

Personal responsibility is the bedrock on which the the strange bedfellows of self-help and conservative politics rest. This core value is most clearly articulated and championed by Jordan Peterson who identifies as a classical liberal. In his own self-help book “12 Rules For Life” he states…<br><br>“To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life, with eyes wide open.”<br><br>While this view may be empowering on an individual level, the centrality of personal responsibility, while not explicitly right-wing, when applied to politics, is often used to justify conservative policies. In this respect responsibility personalities seem to assume we are agents with free will living in a meritocracy. Where they acknowledge unequal opportunity they reference “privation” as “character building” - Friedrich Nietzsche would have agreed.</p>
