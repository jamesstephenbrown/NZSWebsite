DEPOPULATION IS NOT GENOCIDE</h1><p>

Humanity has failed to flourish proportionately with our increasing technology because of humanity’s “elastic waistband”, our propensity to overpopulation. Every time we have found a way to improve our lot, we have filled that “lot” with more people. It seems obvious to most that depopulation, through lowering the birthrate, is necessary, and should not be seen as some evil plot equivalent to killing the population (but this is bizarrely an objection I’ve come across). Succeeding in this venture could possibly improve the well-being of the entirety of humanity in a way we have never seen in history. </p>
