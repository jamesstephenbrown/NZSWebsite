WORLD GOVERNMENT</h1><p>

There is no denying that the globalist end game is world government. It’s a scary idea, yes, and we should approach this piecemeal, learning from the lessons gained from the successes and failures of the democratic processes in the nations over the past centuries<br><br>But is world government even possible with the impotence of the UN? Is there a way to create cooperation without a central authority?  I don’t, by any means, want to suggest doing away with national autonomy. Diversity is important to the robustness of a system so that the fate of the parts are not tied to the fate of the system. Ideally, a world government would emerge from an opt-in agreement where nations benefit from their allegiance. However, observing the examples of the Brexit, recent climate accords and even the UN, do not suggest an easy road to union. But at least, where cooperation has not been achieved this has been seen as failure, suggesting that there is a general consensus that achieving greater levels of global cooperation would be perceived as success.</p>
