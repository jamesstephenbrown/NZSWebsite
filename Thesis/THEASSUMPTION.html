WHAT IS THE ASSUMPTION?</h1><p>

The existence of the first and second laws of thermodynamics seem, on the face of it, to suggest that nothing complex and ordered can arise from from simpler and more random pre-cursors. Now, immediately this brings into question our existence, surely we are more complex and ordered than the solar system that gave rise to us?<br><br>At first this might sound like hubris, but when looked at objectively our solar system can be described using quite simple mathematical models written with ink on parchment, whereas a human brain cannot be modelled currently even with the use of our most powerful supercomputers.<br><br>So, somewhere we have made a mistake, either we are in fact not as complex and ordered as we think, which is unlikely or, simpler, more random processes can give rise to more complex and ordered systems.</p>
