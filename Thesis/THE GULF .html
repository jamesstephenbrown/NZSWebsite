THE GULF </h1><p>

Some might take this reasoning that compassion for anyone who chooses not to end their own life is redundant - claiming they must be happy, as they have chosen life. I would propose that there is a gulf of misery which Camus did not account for where life is simply less fearsome than death - we have not evolved to needlessly end our lives. So, while we might derive, in some sense, lifeâ€™s inherent value to humans from the fact that most of us choose life over death - we cannot induce that we are therefore all content, there may be many people living in the gulf of misery.</p>
