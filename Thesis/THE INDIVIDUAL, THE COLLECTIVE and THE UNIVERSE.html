THE INDIVIDUAL, THE COLLECTIVE and THE UNIVERSE</h1><p>

In the same way as Karl Popper advocated piecemeal progress in political systems, we can appreciate that our own body and mind is a system, a democracy of sorts that is pulled at different times by different and flawed forces. In “Atomic Habits”, James Clear advocates a similar approach, a piecemeal approach to behaviour change. Being kind to yourself. As with society we cannot expect to change wholesale by pure brute force, we have to expect no more from ourselves than we have experienced prior, and grow by small increments. This is consistent with our original position of the principle of emergence. Setting up habits, and habitats that allow for the emergence of sustainable gains. The same principle dictates the universe, the society and the individual.</p>
