AUTOMATION</h1><p>

The relationship between labour and capital has been a tumultuous one - but throughout the centuries a workable balance of power has been maintained. This relationship is about to change dramatically, as automation takes over higher and higher skilled jobs, leaving only highly skilled and creative jobs available to humans. Unlike industrial revolutions of the past, far from requiring less of their worker’s skill level, these changes will ratchet up the skills required, leaving the young grasping for the final scraps and the old unable to adapt. Eventually this could result in what Yuval Noah Harari coined the “Useless Class” who have nothing to leverage in order to protect their rights.</p>
