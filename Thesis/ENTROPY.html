ENTROPY</h1><p>

The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics or "The Law of Entropy" can be understood in its simplest manifestation, as Flanders and Swann described “Heat won't pass from a cooler to a hotter. You can try it if you like but you far better notter” - the result being that the heat, in a closed system, over time will tend toward equilibrium. In general this means that nothing can be built that does result in equal or greater collateral destruction. The entropy of the system will increase until equilibrium is reached.<br><br>This seems to stop any experiment before it begins, by applying to any motion the corrosive forces of the wider system which is grinding everything in it inevitably toward equalibrium. This is incidentally why Perpetual Motion Machines are impossible.</p>
