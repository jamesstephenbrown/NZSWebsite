HOW TO NOT WORRY</h1><p>

In the case of hunger, we do not experience a level of hunger that directly maps our remaining calories. Imagine the sort of panic one would feel in the wild if, as they got hungry they became incapacitated with pain. That doesn’t sound very advantageous. What we in fact experience are waves of hunger, and when fasting you’ll notice that there are times, hours into the fast, that the hunger fades, you may even feel you have more energy. People who fast regularly find even their<br>periods of hunger are less associated with negative feelings of “hanger” or fear or pain because they understand that it will subside.</p>
