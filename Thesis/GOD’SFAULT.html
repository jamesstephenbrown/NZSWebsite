GOD’S FAULT </h1><p>

It seems strange to think of religious belief as stemming from the assumption of “malicious” agency, because religions all claim to revere goodness and kindness as the highest qualities of their figurehead. However, that is marketing - over thousands of years, religions who have survived have emphasised perfection, whereas gods were often to blame for the miseries or “punishments” that we now understand as natural disasters. If you have no scientific explanation for thunderstorms, famine or disease and you hard-wired to assume malicious agency, then it is no wonder the gods of old were malicious and punitive. Humanity needed someone to blame for the maladies of existence… the fact that the need to blame is so powerful as to create gods should give us pause when we feel our proclivity to blame others.</p>
