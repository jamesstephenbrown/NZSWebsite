THE END GAME OF EMERGENCE</h1><p>

We could imagine an advanced civilisation, letâ€™s call them the Emergions who have colonised the entire universe due to a technological capacity for harnessing every raw material in the universe. The Emergions are so successful, that they eventually run out of universe... or more specifically they run out of all the raw, disordered material, because everything else is busily performing some function in their universal civilisation. Now, the Emergions are faced with a grim reality; their society is based on order emerging from chaos, but with dwindling chaos reserves they cannot continue or the system will stall out completely - not just locally, but throughout the universe!<br>Could it be that far from the universe seeing an entropic fate, the universe may well draw to a halt with peak order? Could all matter be subsumed into an ordered system leaving no further energy available? Alas, we are getting way ahead of ourselves!</p>
