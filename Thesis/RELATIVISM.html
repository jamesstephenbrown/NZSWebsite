RELATIVISM</h1><p>

To think about this itâ€™s important to look at the idea of relativism; the position that everything is relative. And before addressing Relativism it is important to put aside Absolute Relativism; the position that, because everything is relative, no absolute truths can be attained. This has a major flaw that it is so clearly demonstrated by the steady progress of science and reason. Absolute Relativism holds that science only makes illusory progress and ceases to be true outside of its relationship with individual human minds. However, this is a wholly self-defeating position because the logic used to come to this conclusion must also fall under this radical skepticism. In its purest form Absolute Relativism undermines any attempt at discussion and to my mind therefore disqualifies it from comment on philosophy or science. So, why am I bringing up relativism?</p>
