FERMI PARADOX</h1><p>

What makes any existential threat seem that much more likely is the fact that, while we have established that the starting conditions for life are present throughout much of the universe. And yet we have not met another intelligence out there. If there are numerous other intelligent lifeforms out there, it is very unlikely that we are the most intelligent or developed - therefore we should expect to have been contacted by now. The fact that we havenâ€™t suggests that there may be some stumbling block that drives an advanced civilisation not just to fall, but attaining globally destructive technology, will go completely extinct along with all other life.</p>
