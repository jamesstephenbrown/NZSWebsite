WHO ARE YOU TO SAY THAT SUFFERING IS BAD? </h1><p>

While the assumption has already been made by the religious apologist that chaos and therefore suffering is bad, they may protest that there is no objective way to claim that suffering is bad, except in the case of a religious story in which suffering is a punishment for our fallen nature (in the case of Christianity). To this, I would have to appeal to their intellectual honesty and claim that suffering is inescapably value-laden, and that, though suffering is a subjective experience that does not mean to say that it is different for everyone, we share the vast majority of our physiology, and while some sorts of suffering are associated for some with pleasure, unless someone tells you otherwise itâ€™s safe to say that they will not appreciate you inflicting pain on them. Of course there is room of delayed gratification in this, for instance, there is no moral value in telling someone not to go for a jog because they may suffer some minor muscle aches. The pain of voluntarily putting yourself through physical and mental hardship in order to build strength is simply investing in future pleasure.<br></p>
