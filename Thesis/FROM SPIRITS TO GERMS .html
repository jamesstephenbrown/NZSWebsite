FROM SPIRITS TO GERMS </h1><p>

From a modern perspective the germ theory of disease seems a perfect counter-example of a profound truth that made a tremendous difference to everyday people; the imperative to wash one’s hands has itself saved billions of lives. However, even this theory when it was proposed by Girolamo Fracastoro in 1546 failed to make a splash, partly because pseudoscientific theories had lucked upon some practices that were effective. The prevailing Miasma (or “Bad Air”) Theory at the time, at least, warned people away from rotting food and flesh, despite having no sound scientific explanation why they should.<br><br>Even the paradigm of spiritual possession and witchcraft had developed some practices that informed behaviour consistent with the germ theory; the idea of quarantine, animistic gods providing treatment via plant leaves and concepts of impurity. This does not mean to say there was any merit to these beliefs, they are better viewed as rationalisations to justify behaviours born of evolutionary utility. But over time, practices evolved in a way such that germaphobic tendencies were in full swing before the germ theory of disease was finally accepted in the late 19th Century.</p>
