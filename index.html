			<h1>ARRIVAL</h1>

			<p>In Denis Villeneuve’s “Arrival”, Louise Banks is asked by her daughter Hannah for a “more sciencey term” for a “win win" situation. At this point I annoyingly lean over to Natalie sitting beside me in the theatre and whisper “non-zero-sum game”. The scene continues to reveals the circular nature of time in the film, when the future (or past) dialogue ensues…</p>

			<br /> Agent Halpern<span class="tab">“How will we ever get them to give up their data?”</span>
			<br /> Ian<span class="tab">“We offer them ours.”</span>
			<br /> Colonel Weber<span class="tab">“A trade?”</span>
			<br /> Ian<span class="tab">“It’s a non-zero-sum game.”</span>
			<br />
			<br /> Louise<span class="tab">“Non-zero-sum game.”</span>
			<br /> Hannah<span class="tab">“That’s it.”</span>

			<p>I turn, readying my "I called it" look... no response from Natalie.</p>
			<p>Non-zero-sum games are a central to Game Theory and a personal fascination. While this site does not represent a primer on Game Theory, it will take game theoretical principles and use them to explore real world dynamics through games and simulations.</p>
			<p>Many of these experiments are hosted at the fabulous indie game site <a href="https://nonzerosum.itch.io" target="_blank">itch.io</a></p>

				<p>Something I've been experimenting with is an interactive essay format, which generates a self-organising node map which depicts the relationships between ideas as you explore them.</p>
