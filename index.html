			<h1>ARRIVAL</h1>

			<p>In Denis Villeneuve’s “Arrival”, Louise Banks is asked by her daughter Hannah for a “more sciencey term” for a “win win" situation. At this point I annoyingly lean over to Natalie sitting beside me in the theatre and whisper <i>“non-zero-sum game"</i>. The scene continues to reveal the circular nature of time in the film, when the future (or past) dialogue ensues…</p>
			
			Agent Halpern:   <b><i>How will we ever get them to give up their data?</i></b>
			<br /> Ian:   <b><i>We offer them ours</i>.</b>
			<br /> Colonel Weber:   <b><i>A trade?</i></b>
			<br /> Ian:   <b><i>It’s a non-zero-sum game.</i></b>
			<br />
			<br /> Louise:   <b><i>Non-zero-sum game.</i></b>
			<br /> Hannah:   <b><i>That’s it.</i></b>
			
			<p>I turn, readying my <b><i>I called it</i></b> look... no response from Natalie.</p>
			<p>Non-zero-sum games are central to <em>Game Theory</em> and are a personal fascination. This site is not a primer on non-zero-sum games or game theory, but a personal exploration that ducks in and out of these subjects. The non-zero-sum game underpins much of my thinking and creativity. I am a creative generalist and this psuedo-blog will be made up of essays, games, artwork and video - that illustrate one person's attempt to understand the nature of existence.</p>

			  <h1>MEMORIES: A RECURRING DREAM</h1>
				
			  <p>My memories begin with a recurring dream, before any sense of the physical world, an abstract space in which I am very small, a shiny blue marble, vulnerable, easily consumed. Around me is mystery and prickly orbs of a sickly pollen-orange colour and texture loom, hungry. As I am drawn inevitably inside the form, it expands, relative to my approach so that the moment is drawn out, the terror prolonged, pensive, sinister. In making way for me, the brim of a surrounding wave closes in around me, and yet brings no closure with it, this cavern once sealed, is at once, as the night’s sky; open, but I am no longer there.</p>
			  <p> Elements of this dream would be triggered by events in my early childhood, bringing with it the immediate terror it had originally evoked. Strangely it was not triggered by imagery but by voices, the slightly too slow voice of a computer game character, or a resonant line in a film, I would have to stop the voice, it worried me, as if it was on the inside speaking and yet foreign and unfriendly. But now the story I tell of the dream is merely me grasping at a handful of images, memories of poor descriptions I gave myself and my parents in my early childhood. Sometimes I wish I could feel that fear again and measure myself against it. </p>

			  <h1>THE COSMIC LOTTERY</h1>
				
			<p>Imagine you wake up one morning to a phone call, you’ve won a million dollars in the weekly lotto draw, but you don’t remember entering. The operator informs you that the government has, in a bizarre act of wealth redistribution, put your tax dollars towards a single lottery ticket every week for every person in the country. Somehow you have been completely ignorant of this fact for over a decade. You receive your cheque and are handed an NDA, in another bizarre twist it turns out the program is completely secretive, no one knows about this lottery until they win it.
			<p></p>
			What are the chances you would win such a competition? Well, since the lottery has been running for 10 years, your country has a population of a 10 million, all of the money each week is allotted to the winner and no one can win twice, you have a 1 / 5000 chance of having won it by now. Not great odds. However, from the perspective of everyone who is aware of the lottery (the 2000 winners so far), the chances of winning are 100%.
			<p></p>
			We have no idea how many entries we’ve had in the cosmic lottery, but we know that all the other entries that did not win the prize of consciousness are not aware they haven’t won. The fact that we live in a universe where there exist beings that perceive the universe, is actually unremarkable, on the contrary it is inescapable. If there were to be other possible universes that didn’t contain agents capable of perception, they would never be perceived.</p>

			  <h1>GRAVITON</h1>
				
			  <p>Now, I’m no physicist… but bear with me, we all have to make sense things and this is my attempt to, I’ll try to keep it science-y. In a sense the universe itself may be inevitable. If you look at the way particles can interact, they can either pull or push other particles - this is all they can do. But apply this en masse to a field of points, even completely randomly, and you will create patterns - surprisingly lifelike patterns that will remind you of gravitational bodies, atoms, even life forms.</p><p>With no design it seems there may be consistent patterns that are inescapable. This is an idea I have explored in simulation.</p>
