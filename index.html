			<h1>ARRIVAL</h1>

			<p>In Denis Villeneuve’s “Arrival”, Louise Banks is asked by her daughter Hannah for a “more sciencey term” for a “win win" situation. At this point I annoyingly lean over to Natalie sitting beside me in the theatre and whisper <i>“non-zero-sum game"</i>. The scene continues to reveal the circular nature of time in the film, when the future (or past) dialogue ensues…</p>
			
			Agent Halpern:   <b><i>How will we ever get them to give up their data?</i></b>
			<br /> Ian:   <b><i>We offer them ours</i>.</b>
			<br /> Colonel Weber:   <b><i>A trade?</i></b>
			<br /> Ian:   <b><i>It’s a non-zero-sum game.</i></b>
			<br />
			<br /> Louise:   <b><i>Non-zero-sum game.</i></b>
			<br /> Hannah:   <b><i>That’s it.</i></b>
			
			<p>I turn, readying my <b><i>I called it</i></b> look... no response from Natalie.</p>
			<p>Non-zero-sum games are central to <em>Game Theory</em> and a personal fascination. This site is not a primer on the subject, but something personal that explores ducks in and out of this subject, and uses it to make sense of life.</p>

			  <h1>MEMORIES: A RECURRING DREAM</h1>
				
			  <p>My memories begin with a recurring dream, before any sense of the physical world, an abstract space in which I am very small, a shiny blue marble, vulnerable, easily consumed. Around me is mystery and prickly orbs of a sickly pollen-orange colour and texture loom, hungry. As I am drawn inevitably inside the form, it expands, relative to my approach so that the moment is drawn out, the terror prolonged, pensive, sinister. In making way for me, the brim of a surrounding wave closes in around me, and yet brings no closure with it, this cavern once sealed, is at once, as the night’s sky; open, but I am no longer there.</p>
			  <p> Elements of this dream would be triggered by events in my early childhood, bringing with it the immediate terror it had originally evoked. Strangely it was not triggered by imagery but by voices, the slightly too slow voice of a computer game character, or a resonant line in a film, I would have to stop the voice, it worried me, as if it was on the inside speaking and yet foreign and unfriendly. But now the story I tell of the dream is merely me grasping at a handful of images, memories of poor descriptions I gave myself and my parents in my early childhood. Sometimes I wish I could feel that fear again and measure myself against it. </p>
